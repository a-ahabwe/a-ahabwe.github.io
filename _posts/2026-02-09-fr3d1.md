title: "FR3-D1: Simulating the Office of Incident Assessment and Response"
---

### The "Un-serious" Project
I spend a bit too much time thinking about *The Magnus Protocol* podcast. This project is a functional simulation of **FR3-D1**, the search and classification system used by the (fictional) Office of Incident Assessment and Response.

### What it does
Originally inspired by the work of Tumblr user aukiq, I collaborated with them on this to simulate how the OIAR processes supernatural statements and incidents.

* **Classification Logic**: I built the system to categorize incidents according to the specific codes used in the show (e.g., *Statement*, *Blog Post*, or *Article*).
* **Format Fidelity**: The simulation ensures every entry follows the exact transcript format described by the show's creators, Rusty Quill.
* **The Goal**: It’s part digital museum, part technical challenge—making a fictional UI feel real through code.

### Technical Stack
* Built with HTML and CSS to handle the case file generation and formatting.
* Designed to be easily maintained for future "incidents."
