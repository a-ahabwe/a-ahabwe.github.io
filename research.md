## Research Journey

I am a Biomedical and AI Engineer currently bridging the gap between signal processing, machine learning, and neural data analysis. My research focus is on building inclusive healthcare technology and understanding neural circuits through computational modeling.

### 🧠 Computational Neuroscience
* **Neural Data Analysis (Simons Imbizo 2026):** Analyzed the Hatsopoulos Reaching Task using PCA and modeled synaptic plasticity through Spiked-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
* **Digital Twin Simulation:** Developed a Python-based Digital Twin model to simulate neural activity and explored the AdEx model for neural modeling.
* **Brain Circuit Modeling:** Gained hands-on experience in modeling brain circuits using materials from the Allen Institute.

### 🏥 AI for Healthcare & Inclusive Tech
* **Addressing Technical Bias:** Investigated biases in neurological and respiratory monitoring technologies specifically for African populations to ensure device equity.
* **Oncology Data Gaps:** Collaborated on a multimodal AI pipeline to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) datasets for breast cancer research in Africa.
* **HumekaFL:** Worked on the automated detection of neonatal asphyxia using Federated Learning to improve infant health outcomes.

### 🤖 Reinforcement Learning & Systems
* **Tactical RL Wargame:** Built a grid-based environment where agents (DQN/PPO) navigate resource management, exploring the "human-veto" authority for high-risk AI decision-making.
* **Digital Health Adoption:** Managed a multi-city study across Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana to predict patient readiness for mobile health platforms using socioeconomic factors.
