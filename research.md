## Research Journey

[cite_start]I am a Biomedical and AI Engineer currently bridging the gap between signal processing, machine learning, and neural data analysis[cite: 2, 4, 5]. [cite_start]My research focus is on building inclusive healthcare technology and understanding neural circuits through computational modeling[cite: 4, 6, 59].

### 🧠 Computational Neuroscience
* [cite_start]**Neural Data Analysis (Simons Imbizo 2026):** Analyzed the Hatsopoulos Reaching Task using PCA and modeled synaptic plasticity through Spiked-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)[cite: 52, 54, 55].
* [cite_start]**Digital Twin Simulation:** Developed a Python-based Digital Twin model to simulate neural activity and explored the AdEx model for neural modeling[cite: 56, 57].
* [cite_start]**Brain Circuit Modeling:** Gained hands-on experience in modeling brain circuits using materials from the Allen Institute[cite: 58, 59].

### 🏥 AI for Healthcare & Inclusive Tech
* [cite_start]**Addressing Technical Bias:** Investigated biases in neurological and respiratory monitoring technologies specifically for African populations to ensure device equity[cite: 79, 80].
* [cite_start]**Oncology Data Gaps:** Collaborated on a multimodal AI pipeline to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) datasets for breast cancer research in Africa[cite: 27, 74, 85].
* [cite_start]**HumekaFL:** Worked on the automated detection of neonatal asphyxia using Federated Learning to improve infant health outcomes[cite: 87].

### 🤖 Reinforcement Learning & Systems
* [cite_start]**Tactical RL Wargame:** Built a grid-based environment where agents (DQN/PPO) navigate resource management, exploring the "human-veto" authority for high-risk AI decision-making[cite: 62, 63].
* [cite_start]**Digital Health Adoption:** Managed a multi-city study across Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana to predict patient readiness for mobile health platforms using socioeconomic factors[cite: 66, 68, 69].
