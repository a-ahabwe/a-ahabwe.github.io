                                I mean, it started as a joke. Channel Six approached me in ninety-four to be the host and frontman of their Saturday night variety show. It was a risky move back then, of course – Channel Six had only existed for a year and I wasn’t exactly a household name. I mean, I was part of the BBC’s family programming, but I was hardly top of anyone’s list.<br><br>
            
                                Still, “Nigel Dickerson presents Saturdays on Six,” or “Nigel’s SOS,” as they started calling it, really took off. I mean, at the end of the day it was still the same sort of variety show that BBC and ITV were running on Saturday primetime: skits, music, interviews, some on-location features. What marked us out, though, was that we didn’t take ourselves nearly as seriously as them. The whole conceit was that the set was built like an enormous comedy dungeon, and I’d been imprisoned by “Mr Six.”

                Well, one of our big things was pranks. We had a whole section called “You Got Berried!” where we’d invite on some serious public figure and make them look a bit silly, like, uh, get a famous footballer to do a bunch of kick-ups but we’d weighted the ball, and at the end I’d come out, say “You Got Berried!” and give them this big golden raspberry trophy. It was all in fun, of course. No guests were hurt.<br><br>
            
                So, one day, my producer, Rich, had this fantastic idea. We do the whole schtick of inviting a famous person on, someone really serious, and we tell them we’re going to have them do a segment with a popular children’s entertainer. Now, obviously these folks won’t have any idea about what kids are actually watching, so we could come up with the most horrendous thing, claim kids loved it, and see how long it took for the guest to realize that <u>they</u> were the joke. That they’d been “berried.”<br><br>
            
                So I came up with this awful clown character – this big, bulbous, splotchy suit, running around, screaming his own name and generally being a nightmare.

                                I remember the first show we used him. We’d invited Gotard Rimbaeu – the chef. He was very big at the time. Lots of TV appearances, a cooking column in The Times. But I think he was looking to soften his public image after the Mirror ran a story on him, I don’t quite remember…</td>

                                Rimbeau tried to keep it together, as far as he knew all the kids did love Mr Bonzo, but when that big rubbery clown started knocking over pans and smashing eggs all over the studio kitchen, the “snooty chef” actually tried to hide behind a shelving unit. And finally, when Mr Bonzo went in for a cuddle, Rimbeau genuinely attacked him with a frying pan. He actually broke the arm of the guy wearing him, which I took as my cue to enter with the Golden Berry. This was on live TV, don’t forget.</td>
