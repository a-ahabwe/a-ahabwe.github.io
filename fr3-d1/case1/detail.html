                    Anyone know what the deal is with the Magnus Institute? Recently moved back to Manchester and I’ve been keen to keep up my spelunking, so was looking at the lists here of good sites to check out.
                    <br><br>
                    There’s some great ones on there (I have got to check out the old Hippodrome at some point!), but I’m a bit confused about the Magnus Institute. It’s listed under “cleared,” but there’s no pictures or info. I get that it’s useful to have a way of saying a place has been explored to death, but usually when that’s the case there’s at least a few photos that can be found online. Is it worth me checking out? It’s only a half hour from me, but I don’t want to bother if it’s genuinely a solved site and there’s nothing there worth seeing.

                    Not sure. I don’t think ArcherK has updated those lists in a while. Don’t remember it, though. I say go for it – if there aren’t any pictures about, seems like a good reason to see for yourself.

                    I do update them when people send me through stuff, but it doesn’t happen all that often. I’m mainly just adding stuff to Devan’s old lists from when he left. I don’t know why he put the Magnus Institute on the Cleared list. Never really thought about it. Maybe it’s been a self-fulfilling thing, and no one’s been checking it out because it was put on there by accident.

                    Sorry, yeah, that’s the problem. Having a really tough time actually uploading any of the pictures I took. Plus not been feeling super well. Forgot how weirdly paranoid I can get after spelunking. <br><br>

But yeah, the building’s an odd one. Looks like it hasn’t been touched since the fire, and that was, what, 20 years ago? Structure itself is in pretty good shape – a lot of damage and scorching, plus the third floor is pretty much gone, but the rest of the building is safe enough. There was one spot where my foot went through the floor, but tbh that was mostly me being careless. <br><br>

It’s got a really cool vibe, though. Like, if you’d told me it was a Victorian asylum or something before the fire I reckon I’d have believed you. Lost of austere old furnishings that are still in decent nick, and a bunch of offices like little cells. Kept getting this sense like doors were going to slam shut and lock behind me, even though half the frames didn’t even have actual doors left in them. <br><br>

Big surprise was no old papers. I mean, they’d be mulch by now, obviously, but all the old filing cabinets were still rusting in place, and there was clearly what used to be a massive library or archive or something in the first basement layer. Was really expecting a bunch of paper pulp, but there wasn’t really any. Maybe that’s why it was listed as “cleared”? <br><br> 

Also, I don’t know how to describe it really, but there was a bunch of old graffiti. I don’t mean tags or anything, I didn’t see any tags at all, actually, and it wasn’t your standard “YOUR SOUL IS FORFEIT” spooky ruins graffiti, it was like… symbols and stuff and some pretty suspicious stains on some floors. I don’t really know occult or whatever, but I dunno. Felt legit in a way most of it doesn’t. I know a few of you do graff stuff, so I wouldn’t mind picking your brains about it later. <br><br>

                    The photos from the spelunk seem properly gone, but I did find an old wooden thing with a bunch of similar symbols on. Some kinda empty box, not really sure what for, though. Gonna see if I can get the light right for a decent pic.
                    <br><br>
                    Edit: No dice, I’m afraid. Must be something up with my phone camera. Really not helping the whole paranoia thing either. Anyone know anything about photographic distortion? Gonna see if I can borrow my dad’s SLR tomorrow.

                    Just to be clear, theft from explorations is not endorsed by this site, so I trust you were simply remembering something you saw, and not admitting to taking souvenirs.

                    I don’t know where this aggression is coming from, RedCanary, but to be clear, this forum does not allow for direct messages to be sent anonymously, and no one is threatening to dox anyone. This is your formal warning.
