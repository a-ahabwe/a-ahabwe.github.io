    <div class="document-body">
      <div class="letter-header">
        From the desk of Mr Leonardo Kennings ACCA, co-treasurer of the Magnus Institute, Manchester, to his esteemed brethren of the same.
      </div>

      <div class="salutation">
        My most distinguished colleagues,
      </div>

      <div class="letter-content">
        <p>By now, I'm sure you have all read the proposal in detail and made your own personal assessments of the formulae and calculations submitted by Dr Welling and his team. I wouldn't for a moment criticise the fine work they've done, or the compelling case they've made for the potential transmutative properties of the dome; nor do I believe they are mistaken about the potential power we might be able to harness, were we to sponsor an exhibit of our own there. I cannot, however, in good conscience support the project as it has been laid out, nor do I believe it is a useful expenditure of the Institute's significant – but certainly not infinite – financial and political resources.</p>

        <p>I have spoken before about my concerns over the choice of the millennium as the date for our grand experiment. I do accept, to a certain degree, Dr Welling's proposition that the turning of the millennium is an important psychological focus of transmutation, thanks to the cultural emphasis of change placed upon the shifting of an "age." That said, I still believe that determining the date should be the province of the astrological, not the cultural. The constellations have played a key role in our researches for centuries, and I fully reject the notion that they should be dismissed as irrelevant to the Great Work in such a way as the Christian god has been summarily discarded.</p>

        <p>It should be kept in mind that the year 2000 has no relevance for cultures that do not use the Gregorian calendar, of which there are many. It means nothing to the Chinese, Indian or Hebrew calendars, and thus excludes vast swathes of the global population from our equations. The stars, by contrast, are eternal and near-unchanging, thereby providing a far more stable base for a project that has always been conceived of as a universal transmutation.</p>

        <p>I understand, of course, that this particular debate is one that myself and those who think as I do have long since lost, and I do not wish to re-awaken old schisms when a unity of purpose is so profoundly vital to the success of our endeavors at this time. Nonetheless, I believe it is worth raising once again in relation specifically to the Millenium Exhibition proposal, as to go forward with this would tie our intentions even more irrevocably to this conception of Gregorian dates as having true and meaningful significance.</p>

        <p>Even beyond this – admittedly more abstract consideration, I believe that the Dome project is almost uniquely dangerous to our work as a place of power.</p>

        <p>The calculations provided by Dr Welling and his team presuppose that any outputs from the site will be broadly balanced; that as a symbol of the future it captures both optimism and despair – the belief in a better world, and the terror that a new millennium will bring nothing except new ways to suffer. It is my belief, however, that the actual balance of energies involved will be profoundly skewed towards the fearful and despairing, thus invalidating the majority of the calculations provided by Dr Welling and his team.</p>

        <p>Public support for the Dome is limited, at best, and the stated plans hardly inspire confidence in its utopian ideals. Even beyond this, however, Dr Welling's calculations have failed to account for aspects of stagnation.</p>

        <p>This modern social and political order, following the fall of the USSR, has taken root in the popular imagination as a natural and final state of society with an emergent and inherent stability. The turning of the millennium is therefore felt as an "end of history," to borrow a term, and in this context the Dome may be seen as a monument to this order. A full stop. Not to mention a desperate cry for relevance from an imperial power locked in a death-spiral of diminishing importance.</p>

        <p>If my suspicions on these points are correct, these echoes of stagnation, almost entirely antithetical to our transformative ambitions, make the exhibition profoundly unsuitable to be utilized in the work.</p>

        <p>And this is not to mention the location problem, as I believe it may already be in the process of developing into a locus without our intervention.</p>

        <p>You are familiar with the peninsular on the which the edifice is to be constructed – Dr Welling et al explained it in the proposal, though not in great detail. Specifically, I would note that they rather glossed over its history as a gas works, and the incredible levels of soil toxicity that still remain in the area, currently the focus of much of the building and land reclamation efforts that will ultimately allow for the Dome's construction.</p>

        <p>Knowing this proposal was forthcoming, and suspecting that it would elide this particular concern, I myself made the journey down to London some weeks ago to personally inspect the site. I still have connections and clout enough to have a tour arranged on my behalf, and… what I saw there troubled me deeply.</p>

        <p>The laborers were in poor shape – grey-faced with blank expressions as they shifted barrows of dirt and shovelled sodden earth with such rhythmic defeat that were it not for the bright yellow of the excavators and the omnipresent fluorescent waistcoats, I might have believed it an etching of some grim Victorian salt mine.</p>

        <p>Their fingernails were cracked and dirty, their voices were hoarse, and their words often gave way to ragged bouts of coughing. I had not previously considered that there might be any need of mask or respirator, but shortly after my arrival I found myself surreptitiously holding my handkerchief to my mouth and nose, if only to lessen the pervasively acrid smell.</p>

        <p>The foreman, a spritely young man whose weak moustache gave him the air of an overambitious school prefect, was talking excitedly about the engineering of the building, about struts and sheets and material loads, but when I asked him how long he expected the dome to stay up – he went quiet for a moment. He told me he wasn't sure. "Could be there forever!" he said, with an odd manic edge to his voice. "Or it could be gone in a year! You just… never know. Do you? You never know what's coming."</p>

        <p>Something about the way he articulated this thought, this clearly disordered conception of the future, sat rather ill with me. I began to develop another suspicion, that the contaminants of the place were not simply chemical in nature, but may have contained a more psychical poison.</p>

        <p>To be clear, had that been the extent of what I observed, I would not be so vociferous in my opposition to Dr Welling's proposal. Unfortunately, it very much was not.</p>

        <p>Following my guide's strange comments, I began to hang back somewhat from the rest of the group, attempting to make my own determinations without the consideration of being watched. I espied a worker operating one of the concrete mixers that arrested my attention. He was of East Asian descent, Pakistani I believe, and his face was locked on the aperture of the mixer, spinning round and round, as though hypnotized by the motion. There was no-one else in sight, and it seemed to me as though the din of industry and construction had faded somewhat, like it were muted as he stood in his senseless reverie.</p>

        <p>Abruptly, he turned and walked over to a nearby ditch that was in the process of being dug out for the foundations. I could see the tell-tale indications of heavy metals in the earthen edges of it, but he took no precautions as he hopped down into it and began to stare at the wall of the trench, as transfixed as he had been at the mixer.</p>

        <p>Were I writing for a less learned and experienced audience I might take some time here to caveat my reliability and sanity, but given none of us are strangers to the strangeness of our work, I will speak plainly of what I saw for the sake of brevity.</p>

        <p>From the dirt of the wall emerged the same man as was standing before it. He clawed his way out slowly, painfully, as though it were a grave; but this second version of the worker was not identical. His hair was white, his skin wrinkled and pitted with age and illness, and his every movement slowed with the agony of infirmity.</p>

        <p>Were I to guess, I would say he was some forty or fifty years older than the man with whom he was twinned. The younger version, for his part, seemed to break out of whatever reverie had overtaken him, with an expression of purest terror across his face.</p>

        <p>He moved to scream, but before he could utter more than the most perfunctory of cries, the older – or perhaps newer version of him depending upon one's perspective – covered the original's mouth with gnarled and twisted fingers. Despite his, or perhaps its, apparent age, this elderly copy was clearly possessed of enormous strength, and was easily able to pull the young construction worker towards the dirt wall from which it had emerged. The struggle was grim and desperate, but not particularly lengthy, and in less than a minute both had vanished into the polluted ground… the last thing I saw of them both being the poor young man's horrified eyes, disappearing into the darkness and mud.</p>

        <p>I rejoined my guide without comment and had no other encounters worth noting here during my visit, beyond the general malaise induced by the site of which I have previously spoken.</p>

        <p>It should be clear enough, then, why I felt compelled to write in opposition to Dr Welling and his team's proposal to become involved with the Millenium Exhibition and the Dome that is to house it. It is my firm belief that not only is this site already on its own journey to become a decidedly hostile locus, but that the future it represents, and that we are being pushed to incorporate into our grand ritual, is unfit being so profoundly and irrevocably poisoned.</p>

        <p>I thank my brethren for their time considering these letters, and wish them insight in their works.</p>
