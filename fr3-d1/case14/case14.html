        <p>Attending Technician: Alyssa Beck<br>
            Date: 01.08.1995.<br>
            Job Number 8146<br>
            Client Contact: Anthony Walker.<br>
            Property Type: Commercial.<br>
            Address: Resounding Reptile Emporium, Hartshill, Newcastle-Under-Lyme<br>
            Follow up Required: Yes<br>
            Report Type: Call Out<br>
            Note: Follow up postponed until location of attending technician determined.</p>
        <p><strong>Initial Assessment – 15:30</strong></p>
        <p>Call out received from dispatch at 15:05 to attend the property. Client reported that a rat had been spotted in the shop’s break room.</p>
        <p>Upon arrival I met with the proprietor. Shopkeeper was concerned about the potential of fleas or ticks brought in by the rodent. He had clear red-slash-sore patches around his neck from itching. I assured him that, unless he had come into close contact, it was unlikely that he had been bitten or suffered from parasite transference. Most likely psychosomatic phantom bites as an effect of the current heatwave. Worth noting, however, that the strong odour of the shop indicates that the IAQ of the Reptile Emporium is likely below recommendations.</p>
        <p>Follow-up probably required. I suspect that due to the heat and humidity of the shop, mosquitoes may be present, which might also be the source of the shopkeeper’s skin irritation. The Resounding Reptile Emporium backs onto a marshy nature reserve, which increases this risk, although none spotted during initial inspection.</p>
        <p>Requested shop to be cleared of customers for full inspection. Client’s agitation increased, presumably due to business worries, resulting in a brief altercation. Kept mentioning “his burden” and grabbing at my sleeve. Received slight scratch by accident, but no escalation or violence, so no need for full incident report, although anyone following up should be advised there may be a mental health problem.</p>
        <p><strong>Inspection – 15:41</strong></p>
        <p>Break room situated in an annex separated from the main shop by a formerly external door (adequate barrier between main shop and affected area). Customers vacated from premises by client.</p>
        <p>Multiple uncovered food sources present in break room:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>open bin containing various unfinished food items and empty frozen mice packets (snake food, presumably).</li>
            <li>Discarded crisp and sweet wrappers on countertops.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>
    <div class="center" style="background-color:white; padding-bottom: 0px;">
        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Even with the window open, there is a strong smell of spoiled food. Recommended consideration: sealed waste disposal and food storage.</p>
        <p>Ants spotted in and around cabinets, follow-up required for treatment if full infestation identified.</p>
        <p><strong>Further Inspection – 15:50</strong></p>
        <p>Found cylindrical droppings with sheared ends, indicating squirrel. Minimal volume: likely just the one.</p>
        <p>Woodland area and trees directly outside breakroom window. Recommended prevention: mesh grate over window to prevent further ingress. Squirrel discovered on overhead cabinets. Window left fully opened to aid exit. Area sealed.</p>
        <p><strong>Treatment – 16:10</strong></p>
        <p>Retrieved live capture trap from van. Customers granted re-entry to shop floor.</p>
        <p>During room preparation, small hole discovered between wall of breakroom and adjacent room. Used by squirrel as point of egress.</p>
        <p>Adjacent room locked, key requested and signed out with client. Hole sealed.</p>
        <p><strong>Summary – 16:30</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Squirrel found among storage boxes and captured alive with trap. Will seal ingress hole after removal. Captured squirrel appears lethargic, likely injured or poisoned. Remov</p>

                    <p style="margin: 6px;">Police aren’t here yet. They say any minute, but I don’t think it’ll matter. I can hear the operator on the phone, but it’s just noise.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 5px;">Snakes, <em>thousands</em> of them – how could he keep so many <em>in</em> there?</p>
                    <p style="margin: 3px;">Dad, this is for you, for everything you taught me, everything you shared. I <em>need you</em> to know what happened and I know you’ll believe me. Don’t blame yourself for not answering the phone. It’s not your fault. It’s <strong>not your fault.</strong></p>
                    <p style="margin: 4px;">The other room, the one the squirrel escaped to, the one I’m in now, it’s a sort of makeshift CCTV office, just a storage closet, really. All the cameras show the shop interior. Just after I caught the damn thing, when I was about to head out, something caught my eye. On the screen. I wasn’t being nosy, I <em>promise,</em> it was just there, I couldn’t help but notice.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 2px;">The client, the guy who owns the shop, he was reaching over the counter, <em>grabbing</em> at a customer while their daughter stood crying nearby. I recognised the girl, or at least the toy gosling she was holding, remembered how she looked at her dad when I told the two of them to wait outside.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 4px;">It reminded me of us.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 7px;">It’s – selfish, how I wish you were here now, Dad.</p>

                <td>
                    <div class="handwritten" style="transform: rotate(-1deg); font-size: 11px;">
                        
                        
                        
                        <p style="margin: 5px;">When I unsealed the shop floor, the shopkeeper seemed <em>obsessed</em> with continuing his sales pitch to the pair. He was adamant that they purchase a snake and pretty much ignored me entirely. It made me a bit uneasy, so I hung back to watch. Thinking back, I should have noticed he was… off.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 3px;">As I watched the monitor the shopkeeper suddenly lunged forward, clearing the desk, smashing the glass on his way with a crash I heard even through the closed door, leaving him sprawling among the crickets previously boxed on the shelf behind him. They were jumping, flowing, twitching, <em>thousands</em> of them, just juddering pixels on the monitor, but the noise was <strong>palpable,</strong> punching through the wall like a fist. I grabbed my phone and called the police. I-I should’ve gone out there and helped but – but I was scared. I just – couldn’t.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 2px;">I started to explain over the phone and they said something back, but I wasn’t listening. On the screen I could see the customer had scrambled to his feet and he and his daughter were nearly out of the entrance. The shopkeeper lunged one last time and that’s when I noticed he’d… started to change. He was bloated. Swollen around the neck.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 2px;">The door slammed in his face and as he stumbled backwards, something fell from his mouth. I couldn’t make it out, though. The screen was so fuzzy and it was just a blur.</p>
                        
                    </div>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <div class="handwritten" style="transform: rotate(1deg); font-size: 10.75px; width: 275px;">
                    
                        <p style="margin: 2px;">Moments passed with no noise except the screaming crickets and my own thudding heartbeat. The shopkeeper lay completely prone, he hadn’t moved at all, and I wondered if the fall had knocked him out, cracked his skull or something. Then there was movement near his head, and he began to twitch and spasm. I thought it might be a seizure but then – his mouth began to open, wider and wider, <em>impossibly</em> wide, his jaw bones snapping with the strain. And then a horde of slender shapes slithered out.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 5px;">Snakes, Dad. Thousands of them. All from inside him, pushing up through his deflating throat. The floor was lost beneath the heaving, writhing mass of them. I could hear the scrape of their scales on the linoleum, but they made no other sound.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 5px;">Then the owner’s body began to slide across the floor towards the closed door between us. It took me a moment to realise his body was being pulled over the broken glass and debris, carried on the creatures’ backs. Towards me.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 7px;">I got the door locked just in time. This room, it’s a mess. Printouts, delivery notes, a bunch of rejection letters from some <em>institute</em> he pinned to the wall with a kitchen knife. And it’s hot in here, Dad. Too hot.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 7px;">Oh god. I can feel it. My throat is swelling and it – itches. I can still hear all the snakes brushing up against the door and… in the walls, I think. Christ, they’re in the walls…</p>
                        <p style="margin: 7px;">Oh god. I forgot about the hole.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 7px;">I love you, Da_</p>
