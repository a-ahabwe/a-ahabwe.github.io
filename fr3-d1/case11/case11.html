            <div style="padding: 10px;"> 
                <p>Hi Alison,</p>
                <p>You asked for a quick email of confirmation when the work began, just to say everything has proceeded as anticipated. It’s taking longer than usual to dig due to the cold snap, but we’ve already accounted for that in our timelines. We also did some load testing of the ground near the cliff edge, and it looks like there’s only a few graves where the erosion means we won’t be able to use the Bobcat, and that’s few enough that my boys can do that by hand.</p>
                <p>The first few days have gone smoothly, and several units have already been reinterred at Newquay with no problem. David, the medical examiner, seems happy enough with all the precautions we’re taking, and while we’ve certainly had our fair share of lookie-loos, there’s not been any sign of the protestors you were so concerned about stirring up. I guess it helps that no-one’s been buried here for over a hundred years, so it’s not like we’re pulling up granddad. The sailors sleeping here haven’t seen mourners since Queen Vic.</p>
                <p>On a personal note, I’d just like to say thank you for using us to do this job. I know we can’t have been the cheapest company to put in a bid, but as local lads we’ve been coming to this graveyard all our lives (even if just to sneak some booze as stupid teenagers), and now that the cliff’s finally giving up the ghost (if you’ll pardon the pun), it feels right for us to be the ones to take it apart.</p>
                <p>Anyway, let me know if you have any other questions. Otherwise, I’ll drop you a line in a couple of weeks when the job’s done.</p>
                <p>Regards, Gordie.</p>

            <div style="padding: 10px;"> 
                <p>Hi Alison,</p>
                <p>Bad news, I’m afraid. Well, odd news, at least. David suggested I keep updating you with what’s going on, as we’ve had to stop work for a day or two while an expert comes down. It shouldn’t impact the timetable too much, so the original budget should cover it, but we can discuss all that later.</p>
                <p>I don’t know if you actually saw us retrieving any units during your visit the other day, but for context, the containers they’re buried in are of really varied quality. I’d say just under half were buried in decent coffins that are still in good enough shape to remove and transport unopened. For others though, the wood has rotted to the point where it’s pretty much impossible to keep the boxes together and some were just wrapped in oil cloth. This means we’re seeing, touching and moving a lot of human remains directly.</p>
                <p>Don’t worry, this isn’t about a health and safety thing – we have all the right gear and David’s making sure we follow procedure. It’s just that one of the graves had a body that was too well-preserved for the age it should have been. Or at least, most of the skin was in extremely good condition. The back was completely covered in this… complicated tattoo of a ship, sailing across an open sea, towards an open horizon. It was really impressive.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, David thinks we need a second opinion and to run some tests to confirm that this body <em>is</em> as old as it should be, as obviously if it’s been buried more recently than 1908 then that technically makes the cemetery a crime scene, and we have to shut down for god knows how long.</p>
                <p>I’ll be honest though, I’m glad of the break. Taking up all these graves is starting to get to me a bit. I almost feel sorry for doing it. The waves are so close and… getting closer. If I were a sailor buried here, I’d take some comfort in that.</p>
                <p>As you can see I’m getting morbid. Short break will do us all some good, I think. Will update you when I hear word.</p>
                <p>Regards, Gordie</p>

            <div style="padding: 10px;"> 
                <p>Alison,</p>
                <p>Can you give David a nudge for me? He’s still working on that body we found and he’s stopped responding to my emails. I got him on the phone, but to be honest he doesn’t <em>sound</em> like he’s in any real rush to complete the job, and while he’s worrying about salt water and tattoos, we’re out here sat on our hands and I’m paying the lads by the day. It’s almost enough to make you dream of sailing away for real. Like that poor fella’s tattoo.</p>
                <p>Saying that, I had another look at the photos David attached and I’m starting to think I might have been wrong about it. When I first looked, I thought it was hopeful, a crew sailing towards the sunrise, but – looking again, the sun is lower than I thought, and there’s a shape in the water behind the ship. I think they’re being chased by something.</p>
                <p>Creepy, eh? Oh, and speaking of tattoos, you remember you wanted an update on local sentiment about the move? Well, I don’t know if this counts as “resistance” – hell, I don’t even know if they’re local – but there’s someone started poking around the site asking questions. Big snake tattoo up their arm and a bunch of other ink. Wouldn’t give their name, but claims to be a big deal “online”? Don’t really know what that means, but they’ve been asking questions about the body.</p>
                <p>According to them, the tattoo is an “Oscar Jarrett,” and that’s a big deal to some folks in that community – something to do with Sutherland Macdonald, whoever that is? Dunno if that’s <em>quite</em> what you were worried about, but thought you’d want to know. They’re kinda giving the boys the creeps. We were thinking of calling the police if we saw them again, but I know you’re worried about backlash, so we’ll hold off doing that for now.</p>
                <p>You should visit the site again when you get the chance. The salt air will do wonders for your mood. It’s weird, I’ve lived here all my life, but spending all this time out on the cliffs – it can still reach you, y’know? The waves crash so loud. You can hear them in your dreams.</p>

                <p>Dear Alison,</p>
                <p>I should first offer my formal apology. I was unaware that my emails were coming across as in any way unprofessional, and shall forthwith attempt to acquit my communications in a manner more becoming of one corresponding with a government official.</p>
                <p>My thoughts and opinions on maritime matters will no longer be included in my emails. In addition, I should be most grateful if you could see fit to provide myself with appropriate authorisations to contact the medical examiner’s offices to follow up with the cadaver that has been causing such consternation.</p>
                <p>Yours sincerely,<br>

                <p>Look, I was not “making fun of you” but I’m not sure what you want. I’m emailing an employer about my work and am getting accused of my emails being “unprofessional.” That’s the best I can manage. I haven’t been sleeping much recently. Weird dreams. Shapes in the water and that. And before you say that it’s “unprofessional” to tell you that, I’m just giving an explanation. That’s all.</p>
                <p>I need you to contact the examiner again, he’s dragging his feet. Besides, I want to see the body again. I dug him up, he’s my responsibility. I just need to see it. I need to know what’s in the water.</p>
