# Hi, I'm Ahabwe! ✨ 

I'm an engineer 👩🏽‍💻 working across **AI, machine learning, computational neuroscience and real-world system deployment**. My background blends **biomedical engineering**, **applied AI**, and **hands-on product experimentation**, from building digital health tools, working with neural data to designing reinforcement learning game environments and fun side projects.

I love building ✨:

* **Intelligent systems** that learn, adapt, and scale.
* * **AI/ML systems** that solve real human problems.
* **Deployment-ready applications** for research, health, and creative domains.
* **Data pipelines & analytics tools** that power decision-making.
* **Experimental passion projects**, like **FR3-D1**, from the podcast **The Magnus Protocol**.
* **RL simulations**, like my human-veto tactical wargame.
* **Digital Twin Simulation**, like the ADHD twin using EEG data
* **Clinical and lab technology workflows** for hospitals and distributed health networks.

💡 I love solving problems that sit at the intersection of people, data, and technology.
