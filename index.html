  <h2>Welcome to my little corner of the interwebs.</h2>

  <p>In my professional life, I am an <strong>AI Engineer & Computational Neuroscientist</strong>. I spend most of my time bridging the gap between machine learning and neuro-health, making sure the future of tech is as inclusive as possible.</p>

  <h3>Not-so-serious Things</h3>
  <p>When I'm not deep in EEG data or AI models, I'm probably thinking about mental health awareness or navigating life in Rwanda.</p>
