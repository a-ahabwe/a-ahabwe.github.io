### Professionally
I hold a **Master's in Engineering AI** from Carnegie Mellon University and a **B.S. in Biomedical Engineering**. I've worked as a Research Associate at **Upanzi Network** and a Graduate TA at CMU.

Based in Kigali, Rwanda, I'm passionate about neurodivergence and mental health awareness.

I like reading, and have a repertoire of close to 200 books on my shelf, and the goal is to have a library(~1000 plus).

Sometimes I write, and maybe you will see it featured here.
