## Professionally

I am a Biomedical and Artificial Intelligence Engineer currently interested in computational neuroscience, attemtping to bridge the gap between signal processing, machine learning, and neural data analysis. My focus is on making neuro-health technology inclusive and accessible.

### Education & Research
* **M.S. in Engineering AI**, Carnegie Mellon University Africa (2025).
* **Data Science and AI**, Tech4Dev (2023).
* **B.S. in Biomedical Engineering**, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (2020).
* **Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo**, Intensive Workshop on Neural Data Analysis & Modelling (2026).

### Experience
* **Research Associate at Upanzi Network**: I manage clinical studies for neurological and respiratory monitoring and develop AI models to fix data gaps in African oncology.
* **Graduate Teaching Assistant at CMU**: Mentored graduate students in Programming for Data Analytics and Probabilistic Graphical Models.
* **Application Specialist**: Previously led the installation and modernization of medical systems across various hospital departments.

## Socially???

I am currently based in **Kigali, Rwanda**. Outside of the lab, I am a passionate advocate for mental health awareness and neurodivergence. 

### A Reader's Goal
I love reading and collecting. My current shelf holds a repertoire of close to **200 books**, but the ultimate goal is to curate a personal library of **1,000+ volumes**. 

Sometimes I write—mostly musings on tech, life, and everything in between. You might see some of that featured here in [The Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/musings/).
